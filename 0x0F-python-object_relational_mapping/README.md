# 0x0F. Python - Object - relational mapping

This project helps connect two amazing worlds: Databases and Python.

The first part will use MySQLdb to connect to MySQL database to execute the queries.

The second part will use the module SQLAlchemy ORM to connect to the database.

ORM, Object Relational Mapper, does not use SQL queries. It abstracts the storage to the usage.
